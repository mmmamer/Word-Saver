Little Dictionary 

Don't you hate it when you see a word you recognise but don't necessarily remember the meaning of?
Now there's a simple solution. 

For lack of a better name. The purpose of this chrome extension is to allow you to learn new words
that you come across while reading papers, articles, books, etc. It's as simple as right clicking 
and saving the word. The definitions along with other details are saved in the extension's popup window
for easy viewing. 

More features to be added are a search functionality, and highlighting of previously saved words if 
you encounter them again. Maybe even a hover-over definition view of words that you have previously
saved.
